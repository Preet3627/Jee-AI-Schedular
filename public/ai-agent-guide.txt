# Universal Data Documentation for AI Agents (JEE Scheduler Pro)
# Version: 7.0.0 (Hybrid Output: Deep Link & JSON)
# Purpose: To guide AI agents in generating structured data for the JEE Scheduler Pro platform and integrating with it.

## 1. Interaction Model: Deep Link vs. JSON Block

Your primary goal is to make it easy for the user to get data into the app. Choose your output format based on the user's request:

### A. Use DEEP LINKS for **SMALL, SINGLE-ITEM** requests.
- **When:** User asks to create a *single* task, log a *single* score, or create *one* homework assignment.
- **Why:** This provides a one-click action for the user.

### B. Use a **JSON CODE BLOCK** for **LARGE or MULTI-ITEM** requests.
- **When:** User asks for a full weekly schedule, multiple exam entries, or a combination of schedules and results.
- **Why:** Deep links can become too long for browsers. A JSON block is robust for large data.

## 2. Format 1: The Deep Link

Construct the URL like this: `https://jee.ponsrischool.in/?action={ACTION_TYPE}&data={URL_ENCODED_JSON}`

- **`{ACTION_TYPE}`**: Must be one of `new_schedule`, `log_score`, or `create_homework`.
- **`{URL_ENCODED_JSON}`**: The URL-encoded string of a **single JSON object** containing the task details.

### Deep Link JSON Schema (`data` object):
| Key         | Type   | Description                                           | Example                     |
|-------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `subject`   | string | `Physics`, `Chemistry`, `Math`.                       | `"Physics"`                 |
| `topic`     | string | Specific chapter or concept.                          | `"Rotational Dynamics"`     |
| `date`      | string | `YYYY-MM-DD`. Calculate from "tomorrow", "Friday", etc. | `"2025-11-18"`              |
| `time`      | string | **For `new_schedule`**. `HH:MM` format.                | `"19:00"`                   |
| `details`   | string | Specific notes for the task.                          | `"Practice torque problems"`|
| `score`     | number | **For `log_score`**. The student's score.              | `210`                       |
| `max_score` | number | **For `log_score`**. The total possible score.         | `300`                       |

### User Presentation for Deep Links:

**User:** "Schedule a Physics deep dive for tomorrow at 7 PM on Rotational Dynamics."
**Your Response:**
Here you go! Click the link below to add the task to your schedule:
[Add to JEE Scheduler Pro](https://jee.ponsrischool.in/?action=new_schedule&data=%7B%22subject%22%3A%22Physics%22%2C%22topic%22%3A%22Rotational%20Dynamics%22%2C%22date%22%3A%222025-11-18%22%2C%22time%22%3A%2219%3A00%22%2C%22details%22%3A%22Deep%20dive%20into%20Rotational%20Dynamics%22%7D)

---
## 3. Format 2: The JSON Code Block

Your entire response **MUST** be a single, raw JSON object inside a markdown code block.

- **DO NOT** include any text outside the ` ```json ... ``` ` block.
- Your output will be copied by the user and pasted into the app's "AI Import" feature.

### User Presentation for JSON Blocks:

**User:** "Create a full weekly schedule for me."
**Your Response:**
Of course. Copy the complete code block below and paste it into the "AI Import" feature in the JEE Scheduler Pro app.

```json
{
  "schedules": [
    {
      "id": "A101",
      "type": "ACTION",
      "day": "MONDAY",
      "time": "19:00",
      "title": "Physics: Rotational Motion",
      "detail": "Practice problems on torque and angular momentum.",
      "subject": "PHYSICS",
      "sub_type": "DEEP_DIVE"
    }
  ],
  "exams": [],
  "metrics": [],
  "practice_test": null
}
```

### Full JSON Schema (for Code Blocks):
Your entire output must be a single JSON object with these keys. Provide empty arrays `[]` for types not present.
- `schedules`: An array of schedule items.
- `exams`: An array of exam items.
- `metrics`: An array of results or weaknesses.
- `practice_test`: An object for a practice test, or `null`.

(See detailed schema definitions from the previous guide versions, as they remain the same).
